# CORONA_Latest_Info_Web_Scraping 
Coronavirus latest Update Information by using API for web scraping and python speech recognition. 

## Description

The idea is we're going to collect all data related to the coronavirus from (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) so all total cases and new cases of each country are our targets. we're going to set up a voice assistant that can actually serve that data to us so I can ask a question like how many cases in Germany or how many worldwide cases right now and it'll actually give us a response and this is going to work using regular expression(regex) library search patterns so rather than using like some ML or AI.
